Welcome to the Modal-Calendar wiki!

Hello,
This is Shafayat. This is my JavaScript calendar plugin. This is an interactive calendar which is easy to control and integrate.
Use of this plugin is very simple. Please follow the bellow instructions.

1.Add calendar.css to your webpage.<br>
2.Add jQuery library.<br>
3.Add calendar.js<br>
4.Now, if you want to show your selected date to a HTML element create an event and call "calendar(this,dateformat[optional],yearlimit[optional])" function on that div.<br>
5.Suppose we want a calendar on a button. On that button we have to add event onclick.<br>
6.Then we call "calendar(this)" function on that event.<br>
7.But you remember that you must write "this" as a first parameter of calendar function.<br>
8.As second[optional] parameter you can give date format "yy-mm-dd","dd-mm-yy","mm-dd-yy".<br>
9.As third [optional] parameter you can give year limitation of you calendar. As for example "1980-2020". This will limit your year selection to calendar.
